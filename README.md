# Portfolio Claire Price

## Description

This project compiles web applications I have created to showcase my personal portfolio. This will be beneficial for job applications and other circumstances where I need to provide an overview of web applications I have completed, in an efficient and visually pleasing manner. 

After being provided with basic HTML starter code, I first built the initial CSS grids and flexbox before adding content and styling. Consideration has also been made to semantic HTML for accessibility purposes. The website has initially been created as a template, with work images included as placeholders for future projects as they are completed.

On completion of this project my knowledge of the concepts behind Flexbox, CSS Grid, Media Queries and CSS Variables has improved. I feel confident in developing this knowledge further through additional research for future projects as required.
